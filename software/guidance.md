# Guidance for software setups

## Install

We provide one intuitive GUI software for running the segmentation with "all-in-one" format. All environments are included in the install package, thus the install package is silightly large (around 6.7Gb). This software will aslo calculate the pancreas volume after segmentation automatically for clinical purpose. Make sure you have a large enough CPU (at least 32 GB) to run it locally.

1. Download the zip file from this [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r28odxe868DpRybzwYzOgHCJtrgual6I?usp=sharing)
2. Unzip it to a local folder and click **install.bat**
3. Double-click the **run_me.bat** file to start.
4. Select input volumes from local folders and wait for the software to segment the pancreas.
