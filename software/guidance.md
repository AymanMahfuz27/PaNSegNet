# Guidance for Software Setups

## Install

We provide one intuitive GUI software for running the segmentation with "all-in-one" format. All environments are included in the install package. Thus, the install package is slightly large (around 6.7Gb). This software will also automatically calculate the pancreas volume after segmentation for clinical purposes. Ensure you have a large enough CPU (64 GB is preferred for large volumes) to run it locally.

1. Download the zip file from this [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r28odxe868DpRybzwYzOgHCJtrgual6I?usp=sharing)
2. Unzip it to a local folder and click **install.bat**
3. Double-click the **run_me.bat** file to start.
4. Select input volumes from local folders and wait for the software to segment the pancreas.
